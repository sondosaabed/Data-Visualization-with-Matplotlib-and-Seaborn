    "1. Create bar charts for qualitative variables, for example, the amount (number) of eggs consumed in a meal (categories: {breakfast, lunch, or dinner}). In general, bar chart maps categories to numbers.\n",
    "2. Create Pie charts. A pie chart is a common univariate plot type that is used to depict relative frequencies for levels of a categorical variable. A pie chart is preferably used when the number of categories is less, and you'd like to see the proportion of each category.\n",
    "3. Create histograms for quantitative variables. A histogram splits the (tabular) data into evenly sized intervals and displays the count of rows in each interval with bars. A histogram is similar to a bar chart, except that the \"category\" here is a range of values.\n",
    "4. Analyze the bar charts and histograms.\n"
